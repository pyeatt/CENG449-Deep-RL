# Mountain_Car
SARSA(lambda) implementation of the classical mountain car problem with Fourier Basis linear regression

Developed on Python 3.10.8 and OpenAI's Gym 0.26.2

The requirements.txt file includes some extra content from my virtual environment, but install with your preferred method and all should be good to go.

command to run: python mountain_car.py

The default basis order is 3 and default episode count is 1000. Both can be easily changed at the top of the mountain_car.py file.
The program will run 990 episodes without visuals, and then visualize the last 10 episodes.
